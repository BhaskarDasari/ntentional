    "## tl;dr\n",
    "- *Looking through papers to track down the Irish-English parallel corpora they used was a real pain, so I built [**nlp.irish**](nlp.irish) to document where to find them and how to process them easily*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What?\n",
    "- The intention behind [nlp.irish](http://www.nlp.irish/) is to make NLP for folks new to working with Irish a **little easier** by documenting the datasets that are available out there, where to find them and how to load them to a pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The site is hosted on [github here](https://github.com/nlp-irish/nlp.irish) with the intention that it will grow via a **collaborative effort** of those working in Irish NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where?\n",
    "- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª [**nlp.irish**](http://www.nlp.irish/) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why?\n",
    "- Irish is a low-resource language and every piece of data out there is valuable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Data\n",
    "- As of writing, 5 commonly used Irish-English parallel corpora have been documented, with instructions on where to find them and **code on how to process them**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ParaCrawl, v6\n",
    "    - DGT-TM, DGT-Translation Memory\n",
    "    - DCEP, Digital Corpus of the European Parliament\n",
    "    - ELRC, European Language Resource Coordination\n",
    "    - Tatoeba\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "- Contributing is as easy as submitting a pull request on Github. Alternatively you can find me on twitter at [@mcgenergy](www.twitter.com/mcgenergy) and I can help update the site with your contibution."
