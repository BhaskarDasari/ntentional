    "## ⚡ [Reducing Transformer Depth on Demand with Structured Dropout](https://iclr.cc/virtual/poster_SylO2yStDr.html) ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "- The introduction of **LayerDrop** in this paper was super exciting to read as it makes a (transformer) model much more robust to pruning while only having to train it once, unlike finding lottery tickets for example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Essentially the idea is simple, just randomly remove/skip different layers during the forward pass in training like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](my_icons/20200508_iclr_2/layerdrop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- LayerDrop can be implemented like so (see the link below for the author's full codebase)\n",
    "```\n",
    "layer_drop = 0.2    # The authors dropped the layers with a 20% probability in all of their experiments\n",
    "for layer in transformer.layers:\n",
    "    if random(0,1) > layer_drop and self.training:\n",
    "        x = layer(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This training setup confers 3 benefits:\n",
    "    1. **Increased Training Speed (training less layers)** \n",
    "        - in training the percentage increase in words per second increased almost linearly with the percentage of layers dropped\n",
    "    2. **Strong regulariser**\n",
    "        - NLP models trained with layerDrop seem to perform better than baseline models trained without it (e.g. EN-DE Transformer performance improvement)\n",
    "        - Increased robustness of deeper models which enables you to increase the number of layers in your model. The authors doubled the encoder depth in their WMT14 EN-DE transformer translation model for a new SOTA BLEU score.\n",
    "        - Increases model stability\n",
    "        - Note the authors also reduced DropOut slightly when training to compensate for the additional regularisation of LayerDrop\n",
    "    3. **Reduction in model size**\n",
    "        - A model trained with LayerDrop can be pruned to any desired depth for inference and still maintain robust performance **without additional fine-tuning**\n",
    "        - The specific type of pruning used for inference also did not seem to matter although **dropping every other layer** seemd to offer strong performance while being straightforward to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unfortunatley when I asked during the Q&A whether this could be applied to when fine-tuning existing pre-trained transformer models, such as those in HuggingFace's library, one of the authors replied that they had tried it but it didn't have great results. Their theory was that these transformers had learned so much during pre-training that a little bit of fine-tuning using LayerDrop wasn't able to have enough of an influence on the model weights to confer this robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code for LayerDrop and **models pre-trained with LayerDrop** can be [found here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/layerdrop). \n",

    "## ⚡ [Playing the lottery with rewards and multiple languages: lottery tickets in RL and NLP](https://iclr.cc/virtual/poster_S1xnXRVFwH.html) ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "- This work is a follow on from [The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635v5) from Jonathan Frankle, Michael Carbin at FAIR, who's research codebase has just been released by the way: \n",
    "\n",
    "> twitter: https://twitter.com/jefrankle/status/1258440816982458368\n",
    "\n",
    "- At ICLR 2020 they present how the [lottery ticket phenomenon](https://towardsdatascience.com/breaking-down-the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis-ca1c053b3e58), which previously was only explored for vision models, applies more generally to deep neural networks across NLP and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- They test it with NLP models, LSTMs and Transformer, as well as reinforcement learning models and found that the lottery ticket sub-networks performed better than randomly pruned networks, as was found in their previous work on vision models. \n",

    "![](my_icons/20200508_iclr_2/lottery.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> twitter: https://twitter.com/jefrankle/status/1103293740465221632\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently the downside to discovering lottery tickets is that they are very computationally expensive to discover. Here the authors trained the models to convergence, before pruning ~20%, reinitializing  and training again. Several cycles of this requires significant computational resources for large models such as transformers and reinforcement learning frameworks. However once a lottery ticket is found it can be trained quickly due to its reduced size whilst still maintaining almost the same performance of the original full network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I'd also recommend watching the authors second ICLR 2020 paper, [\"The Early Phase of Neural Network Training\"](https://iclr.cc/virtual/poster_Hkl1iRNFwS.html), which explored how the \"Early Phase\" of the network training, i.e. the point at which lottery ticket sub-networks emerge (and the point at which Late Resetting would reset to) was impacted by variations to the input data and weight distributions.\n",

    "## ⚡ [Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback](https://iclr.cc/virtual/poster_SJem8lSFwB.html) ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "- The paper introduces a dynamic way to prune weights (Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback, or DPF) that allows previously pruned model weights to be re-activated when needed, resulting in lottery-ticket peformance of the pruned models while only needing to be trained once (unlike lottery tickets which need multiple rounds of training)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The gradient is **evaluated for the pruned model** and then **applied to the dense model**. The binary mask is periodically updated to reallocate the weights. The intuition is that the gradient is used to measure the \"error\" and then the dense model is used to correct this error\n",

    "## ⚡ [Once for All: Train One Network and Specialize it for Efficient Deployment](https://iclr.cc/virtual/poster_HylxE1HKwS.html) ⚡\n",
    "- The idea here is that a single large model can be trained the contains a multitude of high performant sub-networks. These sub-networks can be pruned for use in a wide variety of edge device types and sizes **without additional training**. The author's focussed on training efficient vision models for this paper.\n",
